        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Parathas are the shallow-fried version of chapatis. This recipes make crunchier and less-flaky parathas than those I buy from the store. Serve with cinnamon-sugar for a sweet treat or with curries as a scooping bread.</p>
        <h2><strong>Ingridients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Sprinkle salt on top. Add butter, sugar, garlic powder, and dried herbs. Mix together with your fingers. Pour water in gradually; continue to mix by hand until a soft dough is formed. </li>
            <br>
            <Li>Knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth; let rest for 30 minutes. </Li>
            <br>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Shape into smooth balls; lightly flatten. Dust with flour and roll into thin circles about 1/16-inch thick and 7 inches in diameter.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Fry each dough circle until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. </li>
